* Generic dice have flags when they should not
* Alien should display success as text not as values
* Alien should show dice values even on throwing single die
* 20k20 with flags should display only single final value with flag not "123:flag: = 123" 
* Integration tests
* Create port / adapter for dice throwing
* Move dice logic to system internals
